    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "We built a graph that uses `messages` as state and a chat model with bound tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that the graph can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Return a tool call\n",
    "* Return a natural language response\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this as a router, where the chat model routes between a direct response or a tool call based upon the user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example of an agent, where the LLM is directing the control flow either by calling a tool or just responding directly. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's extend our graph to work with either output! \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we can use two ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Add a node that will call our tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Add a conditional edge that will look at the chat model output, and route to our tool calling node or simply end if no tool call is performed. \n",
